# PRODIGY_DS_03
The goal of **Task-03** is to:

**"Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, based on demographic and behavioral data."**

This involves:
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure all relevant features are usable for modeling.
- Exploring the dataset for insights into key variables like age, job, marital status, and previous marketing campaign responses.

The suggested dataset for this task is the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. This dataset contains information on direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, which includes customer details and whether they subscribed to a term deposit (the product being promoted). 

The task is designed to help understand how customer features influence buying decisions and how machine learning models like decision trees can provide actionable predictions in marketing.
